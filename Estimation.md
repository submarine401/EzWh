# Estimation approach

<Consider the EZGas  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course>

# Estimate by size decomposition

|Estimated effort, in person hours (productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |  780|   
|Estimated cost, in euro (person hour cost = 30 euro) | 23400 | 
| Estimated calendar time, is based on calendar weeks (A team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |5
